# Ublox GNSS

This class provides an API to communicate with the u-blox GNSS chip ZOE-M2B for Ublox C030-R412m board (https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ublox-C030-R412M/).

The files here were originally part of the C027_Support library (https://developer.mbed.org/teams/ublox/code/C027_Support/ at revision 138:dafbbf31bf76) but have been separated out, primarily for use on the u-blox C030 board where the cellular interace portion of the C027_Support library will instead be provided through the new Mbed Cellular API.

This code is a rework and adapted for the Ublox C030-R412m board. The original code for the Ublox C030-R412m is here https://os.mbed.com/teams/ublox/code/gnss/.
